you can leak me documents securely and anonymously by submitting through the Lucy Parsons Labs SecureDrop. [instructions to do so](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/securedrop/)

if you're considering sharing information in the public interest with the press, i: 1) applaud your courage 2) highly encourage you to read the [SecureDrop source guide](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/stable/source.html), which contains useful tips for communicating securely and/or anonymously. this is especially important if what you'd like to share is related to national security.
