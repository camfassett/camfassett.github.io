My technical skills include:
* HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript
* Proficient in Python, including experience web scraping and basic data analysis
* Learning data visualization using D3.js and Tableau
* Limited experience with data analysis using SQL
* Basic video editing skills using Avid Media Composer and Premiere Pro
* Digital security tools including Tails, SecureDrop, and PGP encryption. I've also struggled through using Qubes, a Linux distribution that maximizes security by compartmentalizing your digital life, as my main operating system.
* I know how to use Excel, and by that I mean that I'm comfortable using formulas to store and manipulate data.
