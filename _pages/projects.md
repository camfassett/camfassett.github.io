***A mirror mirroring a mirror â€” Douglas R. Hofstadter***

## [The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker](https://pressfreedomtracker.us)
The Tracker is a landmark data and news website that aims to document every press freedom violation in the United States, from border stops to physical attacks and subpoenas for sources. I produced reporting on these incidents, conducting interviews with journalists, law enforcement, prosecutors, and witnesses when relevant, and often used court records in my reporting. I also contributed to the development of the Tracker website. I spoke with my colleague Alexanda Ellerbeck (Committee to Protect Journalists) at Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) about the Tracker in the summer of 2018.

## [OpenOversight](https://openoversight.com)
A database of law enforcement officers in Chicago, the East Bay, and New York City built using public records and crowdsourced data. I brought the project to the East Bay and to New York City, and contribute code, documentation, obtain rosters through FOIA requests, and assist in populating the database with officers, photographs, and incidents. I spoke with my colleague Jennifer Helsby at OpenOversight at Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) in the summer of 2018.

## Mapping surveillance in New York City
I am identifying and mapping the locations of police surveillance cameras in New York City through public records and collaboration with community groups. Details to come!
