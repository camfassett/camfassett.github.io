# Camille Fassett

## Who?

I am a data analyst, researcher, and reporter interested in machine learning, statistics, maps, privacy, technical communication, open source research, and public interest technology.

I am a data reporter at the Associated Press. Previously, I was a data science fellow at [Human Rights Data Analysis Group](https://hrdag.org/people/camille-fassett/). Before that, I worked as a reporter/researcher at [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/news/?author=741). You can see my CV [here](https://github.com/ssempervirens/resume-cv), and follow me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/camfassett). I have two adorable cats that I post about probably too frequently.
