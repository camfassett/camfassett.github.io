Hi, I’m Camille Fassett. I write things: both code (mostly data analysis in python, visualizations in javascript) and research/journalism (mostly re: tech, surveillance, and policing).

I’m interested in privacy, data science and machine learning, technical communication, good documentation, and public records. Currently, I am a data science fellow at [Human Rights Data Analysis Group](https://hrdag.org/people/camille-fassett/). Before that, I worked as a reporter/researcher at [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/news/?author=741). You can see my CV [here](https://github.com/ssempervirens/resume-cv), and follow me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/camfassett). I have two adorable cats that I post about probably too frequently.
