Hi, I’m Camille Fassett. I write things: both code (mostly data stuff in python, r, javascript) and research/journalism (mostly re: tech, surveillance, and policing).

I’m interested in privacy, data science and machine learning, FOIA, mapping, ethics, and robotics. I care about technology — not as means towards some vague and apolitical idea of "progress" — but rather towards our collective liberation and freedom.
