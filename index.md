*Hi, I'm Camille Fassett.*

I'm a journalist covering civil liberties, technology, police, and surveillance. I'm interested in public records, data, digital security, and using technical tools for creative and truthful ways of telling stories.

I work as a [reporter at Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/people/camille-fassett/), where I co-run the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, documenting attacks on the press in the United States. I also write about surveillance policy, leak prosecutions, and government transparency, and manage our social media accounts.

As a [researcher at digital security and data collective Lucy Parsons Labs,](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/about/contributors/) I investigate policing and surveillance technology. I am implementing a database of police officers that combines crowdsourced and public records data to increase police transparency, and to assist journalists covering law enforcement. [OpenOversight](https://openoversight.com) currently features police officers in Chicago, New York City, and the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area.

I have taught digital security and public records trainings to journalists and activists, and I'm a member of the [Cypurr Collective](https://cypurr.nyc/), which holds trainings about encryption and all-around technical skills at public libraries in New York City. I've also spoken at conferences including [The National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting](https://ire.org/events-and-training/event/3189/3526/) and [Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE)](https://www.hope.net/schedule.html#-openoversight-xkeyscore-for-cops-tracking-and-surveilling-your-local-police-department-).

I'm based in New York City. Please [get in touch](/contact) with tips or ideas for collaboration!
