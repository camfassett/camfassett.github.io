*Hi, I'm Camille Fassett.*

Journalist, researcher, and programmer interested in policing, civil liberties, data science, digital security, and public records.

As a [reporter at Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/people/camille-fassett/) I co-run the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, documenting attacks on the press in the United States, and cover issues including government surveillance, leak prosecutions, and press freedom.

I am a member of [security and data collective Lucy Parsons Labs](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/about/contributors/), where I investigate policing and surveillance technology through public records requests. I am implementing a database of police officers that combines crowdsourced and FOIA data to increase police transparency, and to assist journalists covering law enforcement. [OpenOversight](https://openoversight.com) currently features police officers in Chicago, New York City, and the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area.

I'm based in New York City. Please [get in touch](/contact) with tips or ideas for collaboration!
