## [The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker](https://pressfreedomtracker.us)
The Tracker is a landmark data and news website that aims to document every press freedom violation in the United States, from border stops to physical attacks and subpoenas for sources. I produce quality reporting on these incidents, conducting interviews with journalists, law enforcement, prosecutors, and witnesses when relevant, and often use court records in my reporting. I am visualizing the data we've collected using D3, and I continue to work along with my colleagues to improve the Tracker's methodology. I spoke with my colleague Alexanda Ellerbeck with the Committee to Protect Journalists at Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) in the summer of 2018.

## [OpenOversight](https://openoversight.com)
A database of law enforcement officers in Chicago, the East Bay, and New York City built using public records and crowdsourced data. I brought the project to the East Bay and to New York City, and contribute code, documentation, obtain rosters through FOIA requests, and assist in populating the database with officers, photographs, and incidents. I spoke with my colleague Jennifer Helsby at OpenOversight at Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) in the summer of 2018.

## Mapping surveillance in New York City
I am identifying and mapping the locations of police surveillance cameras in New York City through public records and collaboration with community groups. Details to come!
